# UniPath Android Studio App

## Introduction

This application was developed as a group project at Hochschule Darmstadt for the Human-Computer Interaction Course. "The project saw active participation from three students, with contributions spanning across five distinct accounts hence why the different commits".

The UniPath Android Studio App simplifies the student experience by providing easy access to course information, professor ratings, and feedback. Upon logging in with their immatriculation number and password, users are greeted with a personalized page displaying subjects from the current semester. For instance, first-semester students will see courses tailored to their academic level, while those in higher semesters will have a different set of courses.

The app facilitates seamless navigation between semesters, allowing users to explore past and future course offerings. However, users can only rate and share their feedbacks about professors they have had previous interactions with, ensuring feedback relevance and accuracy. Beyond rating professors, users can also delve into comprehensive feedback and ratings provided by fellow students, aiding in informed decision-making.

To further enhance user engagement, the app features a leaderboard highlighting professors with the highest average ratings and feedback. This leaderboard serves as a valuable resource for students seeking guidance on selecting courses and instructors.

In essence, UniPath streamlines the academic journey by empowering students to make informed decisions through personalized course listings, insightful feedback, and a transparent rating system

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Java for backend logic and XML for frontend UI design.

## DB

If the database doesn't work or you encouter any issues, make sure to change it to the newer DB in the settings. You can find the newer database file `.uniPath2_copy.db` in the repository.

## Video Demo

A video demonstration of the app can be found [here](https://github.com/Cyreexcs/UniPath-Android_Studio-App/assets/70235827/c1304226-79c6-4b2f-9d19-d17e56c94b5f).

Be aware that the current version of the application might differ slightly from the introductory video. The video showcases the latest version, whereas the code pushed to the repository corresponds to an earlier version. We are in the process of addressing minor issues and improving compatibility with the video demonstration.
